# Micrologic
The project aims to create a shell intepreter to run Micrologic.

Hard to use because of there aren't any gui.

Be care for coding errors, or bugging will be tough because there are no error messages (mostly).

(Tip: you can use [Micrologic IDE](https://github.com/HZZcode/MicrologicIDE) for grammar check now.)

Have fun.
